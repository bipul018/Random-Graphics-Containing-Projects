# Random-Graphics-Containing-Projects
These are collections of random graphics containing projects developed using raylib

This project uses raylib library and raylib-cpp c++ wrapper , so kindly link library files ( `raylib.lib` and `winmm.lib` ) and include files to run this project.

Also boost library , specially boost::compute library has also been added which uses openCL , so you have to link openCL library too
